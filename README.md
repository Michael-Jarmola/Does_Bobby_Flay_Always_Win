# Does Bobby Flay Always Win?
 
 This project looks at the popular Food Network TV show, __Beat Bobby Flay__. In the show, two constestants square off in a cooking challenge. The winner moves on to the second round, where he or she will face Iron Chef Bobby Flay. In the second round, the contestant gets to choose what dish Bobby and the contestant get to cook. Watching many episodes, one starts to realize that Bobby really does defeat the contestant at cooking his or her best dish often. Depending on where one starts watching the series, Bobby could get on some hot streaks, and then one might feel he is invincible. Don't worry, this analysis proves that Bobby is beatable. Not only beatable, but we identify Bobby's stregths and weakness, from which dishes defeat Bobby to which Guests and Judges have strong records against Bobby. 

 This project is an attempt to combine my two hobbies, eating and data science. I welcome any feedback and comments!
 
 The data are collected from [Beat Bobby Flay Wikipedia website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Bobby_Flay). We look at seasons 1 - 24. As of this writing, season 24 is the most recent complete season, thus we stop the analysis here.
